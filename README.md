Miscellaneous Scripts I have written for various purposes.

Webscripts
A simple python file upload script

OpenVPN-Randomizer
A script + systemd service to start openvpn and randomly select an .ovpn file to use for the connection. This is useful if you subscribe to a anon VPN service and wish to connect to a different server each time you initialize a connection.
